# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

## Recommended Tools

For best results, it is recommended to use an editor/IDE with TypeScript support, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

This project uses [gts](https://github.com/google/gts). Some useful scripts to run while developing integrations are:
- `npm run lint`: Lints and checks for formatting problems.
- `npm run fix`: Automatically fixes formatting and linting problems (if possible).
- `npm run clean`: Removes output files.
- `npm run compile`: Compiles the source code using TypeScript compiler.
- `npm run test`: Runs automated tests with the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) framework.
